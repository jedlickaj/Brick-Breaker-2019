# Brick-Breaker-2019
Ap Comp Sci final project
# We made the game Brick Breaker and the purpose is to entertain the user

Brick Breaker was originally called Breakout and was created by Atari in 1976. In 2007, Brick Breaker was released. It was the first Breakout type game to be made for cellular devices, for it came out on the Blackberry. This renewed the interest in brick breaking games, and many have been created on cell phones since then. We based our project on the game Breakout. We re-created the classic game by coding the functions of the ball, paddle, and bricks in Processing.


### Difficulties or opportunities we encountered along the way.

The toughest part for us was after we had constructed the bricks we were trying to figure out how to making the ball bounce off of the brick and make the brick disappear.

### Most interesting piece of your code and explanation for what it does.

```Java
for(int i = 0; i<myBricks.size(); i++){
      println(count+=1);
    if(xBall<=myBricks.get(i).getBrickX()+wi && xBall>myBricks.get(i).getBrickX() && yBall<myBricks.get(i).getBrickY()+ hi && yBall>=(myBricks.get(i).getBrickY())){
    
      myBricks.remove(i);
      dY = dY * -1;
    }
  }
  
}
```
This is the code that makes the ball bounce off of the bricks. We have a for loop that goes through the array list of bricks and then an if statement that checks if the x position of the ball and the y position of the ball hit the length of the brick or the height of the brick. If that does happen, dY, which is our y rate at which the ball is moving, flips so the ball bounces off and comes back down.
